# Rolling-Dice

Welcome to the Virtual Dice-Rolling Game! This Python-based project is an exciting multiplayer game where it allow up to 4 players to roll a six-sided die (randomly generated values between 1 and 6). 
Record each playerâ€™s roll and display the winner (player with the highest roll). 
Allow players to play multiple rounds and maintain a running leaderboard showing 
total wins for each player.
Display a congratulatory message for the overall winner when the game ends. 
Added a rule where rolling a 6 grants an extra turn.
